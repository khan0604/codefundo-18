The functioning of the application can be broadly divided into two parts 

##### Pre disaster:
- A news feed providing daily disaster predictions and weather reports.

##### During and Post disaster:
- A common information platform where government and other agencies can provide necessary information(for example location of relief camps etc) and also user can ask for help by sharing his location and other necessary information. 

- Also it serves as a platform for all those who want to help directly by providing resources like food, clothes and also helping them relocate to some safe place (eg: NGO's and agencies) and also for those who want to help indirectly by providing funds and resources which can be supplied to the affected people.In this way it creates a direct link between the donars and the agencies which can make these resources available for the people in need.
